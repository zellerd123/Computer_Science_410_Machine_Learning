**Computer Science 410: Machine Learning**
Welcome to my repository for the Computer Science 410 Machine Learning course. This repository contains projects and assignments completed as part of the course, demonstrating the application of machine learning concepts and techniques using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

**Course Overview**
The Machine Learning course explores the fundamental concepts and algorithms that enable computers to learn from and make decisions based on data. Topics covered in this course include:

Supervised Learning: Linear regression, logistic regression, support vector machines, decision trees, and neural networks.
Unsupervised Learning: Clustering, dimensionality reduction, and association rule learning.
Ensemble Methods: Bagging, boosting, and random forests.
Model Evaluation: Techniques for assessing and comparing model performance.
Data Preprocessing: Techniques for data cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering.
**Technologies and Libraries**
Python: The primary programming language used for implementing machine learning algorithms and data manipulation.
Jupyter Notebook: An interactive computing environment that enables the creation and sharing of documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.
Seaborn: A Python visualization library based on matplotlib that provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive statistical graphics.
Pandas: An open-source library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures, and data analysis tools for Python.
Scikit-learn (sklearn): A free software machine learning library for Python, featuring various classification, regression, and clustering algorithms.
